### Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) Architecture

Instruction Level Parallelism, such as *pipelining*, *superscalar processor*, and *out-of-order execution* add extra hardware complexity. **VLIW Architecture** deals with it by depending on the **compiler**. The programs decide the parallel flow of the instructions and to resolve conflicts. This increases compiler complexity but decreases hardware complexity by a lot. [1]

#### Features [1]
- The processors in this architecture have multiple functional units, fetch from the Instruction cache that have the *Very Long Instruction Word*.
- Multiple indepedent operations are grouped together in a single VLIW Instructions. They are initialized in the same clock cycle.
- Each operation is assigned an independent functional unit.
- All the functional units share a common register file.
- Instruction words are typically of the length of 64-1024 bits depending on the number of execution unit and the code length required to control each unit.
- Instruction scheduling and parallel dispatch of the word is done statically by the compiler.
- The compiler checks for dependencies before scheduling parallel execution of the instruction.
