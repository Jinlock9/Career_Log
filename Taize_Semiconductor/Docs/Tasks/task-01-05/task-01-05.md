### Description
#### Problems
1. Due to Machine Code Sinking, codes are reordered and more fragmented. Without Machine Code Sinking, the order of codes were bb.1 -> bb.2 -> bb.4. However, with Machine Code Sinking, it is reordered to bb.1 -> bb.4 -> bb.2. The problem is that the control flow remains the same. Therefore, there are increased number of branch misprediction, involving the pipeline flushing and stall. This makes kernel to have more cycles.

#### Questions
1. If there is something missing in the current Machine Code Sinking, which is it? Which causes the such effect and how could we improve?
2. Are the test cases are biased?
3. Can we improve execution time if we consider machine scheduling as a factor of machine code sinking?
