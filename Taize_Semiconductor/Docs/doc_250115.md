### .ll
A file with the `.ll` extension is typically an **LLVM intermediate representation (IR)** file in textual format. LLVM IR is a low-level programming language used as the intermediate representation in the LLVM compiler infrastructure. It provides a flexible and universal way to represent code during compilation.

#### Key Features of `.ll` Files:
1. **Textual Representation**:
   - The `.ll` file is the human-readable form of LLVM IR. 
   - It can be easily edited and inspected compared to its binary counterpart (`.bc` files).

2. **Structure**:
   - It includes a series of instructions, functions, and metadata describing program behavior.
   - Designed to be language-agnostic, allowing various high-level languages to be compiled to LLVM IR.

3. **Uses**:
   - **Debugging**: Developers can inspect the IR for optimizations or issues during the compilation process.
   - **Optimization**: Since it is in an intermediate form, it enables various compiler optimizations.
   - **Target Generation**: The `.ll` file can be further compiled into machine code for a specific architecture using the LLVM backend.

4. **Compilation Process**:
   - **Frontend**: Converts source code (e.g., C, C++) into LLVM IR (`.ll` or `.bc`).
   - **Middle-end**: Performs optimizations on the LLVM IR.
   - **Backend**: Converts the optimized IR to target-specific machine code.

#### Example:
A simple LLVM IR code snippet in `.ll` might look like this:
```llvm
; This is an example of LLVM IR
define i32 @main() {
entry:
    %retval = alloca i32, align 4
    store i32 0, i32* %retval, align 4
    ret i32 0
}
```

#### Generating and Using `.ll` Files:
1. **Generate**:
   - Use `clang` or another LLVM-based compiler with flags like:
     ```bash
     clang -S -emit-llvm example.c -o example.ll
     ```
2. **Use**:
   - View the file:
     ```bash
     cat example.ll
     ```
   - Optimize it:
     ```bash
     opt -O2 example.ll -o optimized.bc
     ```
   - Compile it into machine code:
     ```bash
     llc example.ll -o example.s
     ```

### `lit` - LLVM Integrated Tester

**lit** is a portable tool for executing LLVM and Clang style test suites, summarizing their results, and providing indication of failures. lit is designed to be a lightweight testing tool with as simple a user interface as possible.

#### Sypnosis
```sh
lit [options] [tests]
```

#### Manual: [lit](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html#test-discovery)

#### Useful Options
- `-v, --verbose`:  

    Show more information on test failures, for example the entire test output instead of just the test result.

    Each command is printed before it is executed. This can be valuable for debugging test failures, as the last printed command is the one that failed. Moreover, lit inserts 'RUN: at line N' before each command pipeline in the output to help you locate the source line of the failed command.

- `-a, --show-all`:  
    
    Enable -v, but for all tests not just failed tests.

- `-o PATH, --output PATH`:  
    
    Write test results to the provided path.

- `--vg-leak`:  

    When --vg is used, enable memory leak checks. When this option is enabled, lit will also automatically provide a “vg_leak” feature that can be used to conditionally disable (or expect failure in) certain tests.

- `--no-execute`:  

    Don’t execute any tests (assume that they pass).

- `--ignore-fail`:  

    Exit with status zero even if some tests fail.

- `--time-tests`:  

    Track the wall time individual tests take to execute and includes the results in the summary output. This is useful for determining which tests in a test suite take the most time to execute.

- `--order={lexical,random,smart}`:  

    Define the order in which tests are run. The supported values are:

    lexical - tests will be run in lexical order according to the test file path. This option is useful when predictable test order is desired.

    random - tests will be run in random order.

    smart - tests that failed previously will be run first, then the remaining tests, all in descending execution time order. This is the default as it optimizes concurrency.

#### From ChatGPT 4o
In the context of LLVM, **`lit`** is the **LLVM Integrated Tester**, a testing tool designed to run and manage tests for LLVM projects. It is particularly used to test LLVM IR, compilers, and related tools by executing test cases and comparing the outputs with expected results.

#### Structure of `lit` Tests
A `lit` test typically includes:
1. **Test Files**:
   - Contain the code (e.g., LLVM IR or source code) and directives for testing.
   - Usually have extensions like `.ll`, `.c`, or `.cpp`.

2. **Directives**:
   - Embedded comments in the test file that define how `lit` should handle the test.

#### Example of a `lit` Test
- **Test File: `example.ll`**

    ```llvm
    ; RUN: opt -S -mem2reg %s | FileCheck %s

    define i32 @test() {
    ; CHECK: ret i32 0
    ret i32 0
    }
    ```

- **Breakdown:**
    1. **`RUN` Directive**:
    - Indicates how the test should be executed.
    - `opt -S -mem2reg %s`: Runs the `opt` tool with the `-mem2reg` optimization.
    - The `%s` is replaced with the current file name.

    2. **`CHECK` Directive**:
    - Used with `FileCheck` to match patterns in the output.
    - `ret i32 0`: Ensures that the `opt` tool's output contains this line.

#### Running `lit`
1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure that `lit` is installed as part of the LLVM build.
   - Verify that `llvm-lit` or `lit.py` is in your PATH.

2. **Command**:
   ```bash
   lit path/to/test
   ```

3. **Options**:
   - `--verbose`: Show detailed output.
   - `--filter`: Run specific tests matching a pattern.
   - `-j <N>`: Run tests in parallel using `<N>` threads.
